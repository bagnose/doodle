Maybe make each layer handle events, otherwise, how will the selection layer
clear the selection if you click outside of it, for example?

The current scheme of continuing to send events to a tool/handler when it
accepts the button press is inadequate. The tool/handler needs to be able
to make explicit grabs independent of button state.

Selection manager needs to find out about diagram-elements being removed

How about pressing the delete key when item(s) are selected? This needs
to be handled by the something that understands the selection...
